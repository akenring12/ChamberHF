                <h1>A Life Shaped by Conflict</h1>
                <p>
                    Duressa Sakete’s life has been defined by hardship, displacement, and an unyielding determination to secure a better future for his children. Born in Ethiopia, he grew up in an environment of political turmoil and ethnic strife. As a young boy, he did not fully grasp the gravity of the conflicts around him. However, over time, he came to understand that his community was seen as a threat by the government, which accused them of supporting rebel groups fighting for greater political and social freedoms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In his village, the government viewed Duressa’s ethnic group as sympathizers of the opposition. The authorities sought to suppress any dissent, often targeting entire communities with brutal force. As government forces intensified their crackdown, innocent families, including Duressa’s, found themselves caught in the crossfire. The fear of persecution became a daily reality, forcing many to flee their homes in search of safety.

                    “The government wanted to arrest my family and me because of our tribe’s alleged connection to the rebels,” Duressa recalls. The danger extended beyond arrests; military forces frequently raided villages suspected of harboring insurgents. These attacks resulted in tragic losses, with many of Duressa’s friends, relatives, and neighbors losing their lives in what he describes as senseless killings. The horror of witnessing such violence left an indelible mark on him.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    Faced with imminent danger, Duressa and his family had no choice but to escape. Leaving their home was not an easy decision, but survival was their only priority. They abandoned everything—their land, possessions, and livelihoods—embarking on a perilous journey toward an uncertain future. Their only hope was to find a safe place where they could rebuild their lives away from the constant threat of violence.

                <h1> Life in Kakuma Refugee Camp</h1>
                <p>
                    In 2005, after months of planning and an arduous journey, Duressa and his family crossed the border into Kenya. They sought refuge in Kakuma Refugee Camp, a vast settlement housing thousands of displaced individuals from across East Africa. Though Kakuma provided relative safety, it was far from the stability and opportunities Duressa had envisioned. Life in the camp was filled with uncertainty and struggle.            
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Kakuma was not what we expected. We had escaped violence, but here, survival was still a daily battle,” Duressa explains. The camp lacked basic resources, making it difficult to secure food, water, and medical care. Employment opportunities were scarce, and without work, providing for his family became an overwhelming challenge.            
                </p>

            <h1>A Father’s Determination</h1>
            <div class="story-holder">
                <div class="st-content">
                    <p>
                        Determined to support his loved ones, Duressa took on a role as a hygiene promoter with Peace Winds Japan (PWJ). His job involved educating fellow refugees about sanitation and disease prevention. While the income from this work was meager, it was a lifeline that allowed him to sustain his family. Despite his efforts, the harsh conditions of the camp, including limited access to clean water and healthcare, remained a constant struggle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Personal tragedy struck Duressa in 2010 when his wife, the mother of his five children, was diagnosed with breast cancer. With inadequate medical resources in the camp, her condition deteriorated rapidly, and she passed away within a few years of her diagnosis. Her death was a devastating blow, leaving Duressa to care for their children alone. “Losing my wife was the hardest thing. She was my partner in everything. Now, I had to do it all alone—raising our children and ensuring they had what they needed,” he shares, his grief evident.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a single father, Duressa faced immense difficulties. Raising five children in a refugee camp with limited resources was a daunting task. With no extended family to support him, he relied solely on his resilience and determination. His biggest fear was that his children would grow up without the opportunities needed to escape the cycle of displacement and hardship that had defined his own life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Education became Duressa’s greatest hope for his children’s future. He firmly believed that schooling was the key to breaking free from the struggles they faced. However, accessing quality education in Kakuma was a challenge. “The schools here are overcrowded, and there aren’t enough teachers or materials. But I push my children to learn because I know education is their only way out,” he says.

        <div class="story-content last">
            <h1>A Father’s Dream</h1>
            <p>
                Despite these obstacles, Duressa remains committed to ensuring that his children have the best chance at a better life. His dream is for them to leave the camp, pursue careers, and contribute to society in ways he never could. “I want them to have opportunities I never had. I want them to be able to stand on their own,” he says with determination.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though he faces his own health struggles, including high blood pressure due to the constant stress of his situation, Duressa refuses to give up. He continues to fight for his family, holding onto the hope that one day, his children will live in a place where they can thrive. His story is one of resilience and unwavering love—a father’s relentless pursuit of a future filled with dignity and opportunity for his children.
            </p>          
            <p>
                Kakuma may be a place of hardship, but for Duressa, it is also a place where hope persists. “I may never return to Ethiopia, but as long as I am here, I will keep fighting for my children’s future,” he declares. His journey is not yet over, but his resolve remains strong. One day, he hopes his children will leave the refugee camp behind and step into a world where they can truly flourish.
